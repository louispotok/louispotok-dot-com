Hi, welcome to Capillary Action.

I'm Louis Potok. 
Right now, the main thing to do here is read my [blog]({{site.baseurl}}{% link blog.md %}). 
You can also read more [about me]({{site.baseurl}}{% link about.md %}) or see what I'm up to [now]({{site.baseurl}}{% link now.md %}).

<h3>What's with the name?  </h3>
<p>
Capillary action is the process by which a liquid diffuses through a series of small tubes ("capillaries"), moving as though of its own accord .

In your body, it's how blood gets from veins and arteries through the much smaller capillaries into your cells. If you've ever dipped the corner of a paper towel into some coffee, you can see it at work as well.

Ideas too seem to spread of their own volition through innumerable tiny channels until they suffuse the whole medium.
