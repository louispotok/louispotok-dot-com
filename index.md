Hi, I'm Louis. I'm the CEO and founder of [Recoolit](https://www.recoolit.com/). We are trying to prevent 1 billion tons of CO2e emissions from superpotent refrigerants, starting in Indonesia.

In the past I:
* lived in San Francisco, working at early-stage startups applying machine learning to challenges in healthcare and financial inclusion
* used behavioral economics to improve government and NGO policies and programs
* studied economics at the University of Chicago.

The main thing to do here is to see what I'm up to [now]({{site.baseurl}}{% link pages/now.md %}) or read my [blog archive]({{site.baseurl}}{% link pages/blog.md %}). You can also see the [colophon]({{site.baseurl}}{% link pages/colophon.md %}) or read my thoughts on [Eternal Websites]({{site.baseurl}}{% link pages/websites.md %}).

<h3>What's with the name?  </h3>
<div>
Capillary action is the process by which a liquid diffuses through a series of small tubes ("capillaries"), moving as though of its own accord and often against gravity.

In your body, it's how blood gets from veins and arteries through the much smaller capillaries into your cells. If you've ever dipped the corner of a paper towel into some coffee, you can see it at work as well.

**Ideas too seem to spread of their own volition through innumerable tiny channels until they suffuse the whole medium.**

There was also [a band with the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary_Action_(band)), but I am not affiliated with them.
