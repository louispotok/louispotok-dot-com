Hi, I'm Louis. Feel free to [say hi]({{site.baseurl}}{% link pages/contact.md %})!

I'm the CEO and cofounder (with Ning Jeng) of [Recoolit](https://www.recoolit.com/). We are making cooling sustainable, with an emphasis on the management of superpotent refrigerant gas.

In the past I:
* worked at early-stage startups applying machine learning to challenges in [healthcare](https://agathos.io) and [financial inclusion](https://trueaccord.com).
* used [behavioral economics](https://ideas42.org) to improve government and NGO policies and programs.
* studied economics at the University of Chicago.

This site contains:
* What I'm up to [now]({{site.baseurl}}{% link pages/now.md %})
* [Questions]({{site.baseurl}}{% link pages/questions.md %}) I've been thinking about
* My [blog]({{site.baseurl}}{% link pages/blog.md %}), 10 years and counting.
* An [unauthorized mirror of the NAEB database]({{site.baseurl}}{% link pages/naeb.md %})
* My thoughts on [Eternal Websites]({{site.baseurl}}{% link pages/websites.md %})
* The [colophon]({{site.baseurl}}{% link pages/colophon.md %}) for this site

  <h3>Disclosure

  <p>Some of the links on my site are through Amazon's Affiliates Program. If you make a purchase on Amazon through a link on this site, I receive a small commission. (The book does not cost you any extra.) I set this up in 2013 because I thought it would be cool, but I've made about $15 lifetime from the program.
