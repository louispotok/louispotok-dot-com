Hi, I'm Louis.

I'm the CEO and cofounder (with Ning Jeng) of [Recoolit](https://www.recoolit.com/). We are making cooling sustainable, with an emphasis on the management of superpotent refrigerant gas.

In the past I:
* worked at early-stage startups applying machine learning to challenges in [healthcare](https://agathos.io) and [financial inclusion](https://trueaccord.com).
* used [behavioral economics](https://ideas42.org) to improve government and NGO policies and programs.
* studied economics at the University of Chicago.

You can read what I'm up to [now]({{site.baseurl}}{% link pages/now.md %}), including questions I've been thinking about. You can also check out my [blog archive]({{site.baseurl}}{% link pages/blog.md %}) or take a look at:
* An [unauthorized mirror of the NAEB database]({{site.baseurl}}{% link pages/naeb.md %})
* My thoughts on [Eternal Websites]({{site.baseurl}}{% link pages/websites.md %}).
* The [colophon]({{site.baseurl}}{% link pages/colophon.md %}) for this site.

# Contact Me

You can reach me by [email](mailto:{{site.email}}) or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/louispotok). My Twitter DMs are open, although I believe Twitter imposed restrictions on DMs in late 2023.

* Tell me if you had a strong reaction, positive or negative, to something I wrote.
* Ask me a favor -- I'll gladly help if I can.
