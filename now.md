## Building [Recoolit](https://recoolit.com).

I'm the founder of an early-stage startup trying to prevent gigatons of CO2-equivalent emissions. The basic approach is to pay AC technicians in lower-income countries to recover superpotent greenhouse gases from end-of-life cooling devices. This gets tracked through software, and generates carbon offsets which are sold to American companies.

If you want to follow along, I intend to send out email updates through [this list](https://buttondown.email/recoolit).

## Living in Jakarta

I moved to Jakarta to work on Recoolit in May 2021. I hope to be here about a year and I'm looking to make friends. If you live here, have friends here, or are just passing through, please [get in touch]({{site.baseurl}}{% link about.md %}).
