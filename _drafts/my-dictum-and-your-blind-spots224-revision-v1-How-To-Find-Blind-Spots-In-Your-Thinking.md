  1. Explain the issue to a child
  2. Ask a third party with &#8220;middle-level&#8221; knowledge of the issue
  3. Find a new taxonomy to organize everything you know about the issue &#8212; the &#8220;worse&#8221; it seems, the better
  4. Premortem
  5. Twiddle the knobs &#8212; assign numbers to everything you can, and change each number to ridiculous values to see what happens. &#8220;What if we had 10 years to do this? What if we only had three days?&#8221; &#8220;What if only 1 person shows up? What if 5,000 people show up?&#8221;
