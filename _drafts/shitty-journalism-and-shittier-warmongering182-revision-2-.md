I want to deeply examine [this article](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/world/middleeast/syria-assad.html?hp&_r=0&pagewanted=all) from today&#8217;s New York Times. Ideally, I wish I could sit down with the author of the piece, the key players quoted, the key players not quoted, eminent historians, etc, and really dig into it. But you, loyal readers, will have to suffice.

> In some of the most aggressive language used yet by the administration, Mr. Kerry accused the Syrian government of the “indiscriminate slaughter of civilians” and of cynical efforts to cover up its responsibility for a “cowardly crime.”

I don&#8217;t understand this at all. What is the purpose of military intervention if not to &#8220;alter the nature of the conflict&#8221;? What is the goal of this? How will launching a few missiles achieve that goal? I&#8217;m reminded of the &#8220;politician&#8217;s syllogism&#8221;:

  * Premise: We need to do something.
