#datakind finish Friday slide deck

&#8220;it doesn&#8217;t get easier, you just get faster&#8221; greg lemond  
on a surface level, this isn&#8217;t true. there&#8217;s a hill by my house, I have to ride up it to get home, and when I&#8217;m riding a lot it does in fact get easier.  
If we take a little more nuanced view, we can say that there&#8217;s a relationship between expertise and speed and effort, difficulty of the task, quality of execution, and that what this is saying is that for a given task, an expert working just as hard can accomplish the same task faster.  
If you put your scientist hat on, you could even develop this equation and go looking for data to train your model. But I haven&#8217;t done that.  
This is useful, but I think there&#8217;s a deeper point. This isn&#8217;t a fact at all. It&#8217;s not a descriptive statement about the world.  
It&#8217;s advice.  
Because by default, things do get easier. You get better, and things get easier and after a while maybe you forget what it&#8217;s like for that thing to be hard at all. You ride your bike home and you just want to get to the top of that hill and you don&#8217;t really care how long it takes you.  
But what this sentence is saying is that there&#8217;s an alternative.  
There are some parts of life that are worth the difficulty, that truly reward continuous improvement. And in those areas, this sentence is suggesting that we strive to act in a way where at every moment we are operating at the very limit of our capacities.  
And I&#8217;m challenging everyone here to do that this weekend.  
I&#8217;m not talking about the technical challenges. For most of you, the technologies you use this weekend will probably be less sophisticated than what you&#8217;re used to in your day jobs. The data is going to fit on your laptop easily, and you&#8217;ll probably end up using fairly straightforward analytical techniques.  
If you&#8217;re using a cutting edge deep learning approach, you&#8217;re probably doing it wrong.  
The real challenges here are about how we work together. We&#8217;re throwing you together into teams with new people, and we&#8217;re asking you to use a certain set of tools, and work towards some goals that we&#8217;ve defined in advance. That&#8217;s a lot to ask!  
So if this weekend is going to be successful, and I know that it is, it&#8217;s going to take a certain dedication from each of us. Let&#8217;s challenge ourselves and each other to operate at the very outer boundary of how well we can collaborate together, how much we can communicate, and trust one another, and respect one another, and be kind, and teach each other and learn from each other.
