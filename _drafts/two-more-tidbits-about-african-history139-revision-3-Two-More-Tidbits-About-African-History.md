From my notes about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Africa-Biography-Continent-John-Reader/dp/067973869X" target="_blank">John Reader&#8217;s Africa</a>, two fascinating and poetic tidbits to go along with my two previous posts (<a title="Annals of Comparative Advantage" href="http://louispotok.com/annals-of-comparative-advantage/" target="_blank">hereÂ </a>and <a title="Africa: Reproductive Strategies and the Value of Gold" href="http://louispotok.com/africa-reproductive-strategies-and-the-value-of-gold/" target="_blank">here</a>).

However, Da Gama&#8217;s &#8220;arrival inaugurated an age of European maritime power in the [Indian Ocean] region&#8230;fellow-countrymen and co-religionists [of Ibn-Madjid] cursed his memory; and in his old age, Ibn-Madjid himself bitterly regretted what he had done.&#8221; (359)</span>

However, &#8220;the fate of the Africans who had been set ashore, dressed in European fashion, and bearing samples of gold, silver, and spices, is not known.&#8221; (347)</span>
