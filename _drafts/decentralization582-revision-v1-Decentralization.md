A very thoughtful recent [blog post](https://hackernoon.com/decentralizing-everything-never-seems-to-work-2bb0461bd168) makes the point that institutions that seem &#8220;decentralized&#8221; or claim that as a value often exhibit centralizing tendencies over time. Some recommendations:

  * **Be specific** about what things you want to decentralize, and why. Regard decentralization as an ongoing process that can never be complete.
  * **Find checks and balances**, so that it is harder for any set of actors to achieve centralizing power. Use multiple forms of decentralization and participation.
  * **Consider accountability:** often what we really care about is accountability, and a centralized but accountable entity (such as a government antitrust enforcer) can limit the centralized and unaccountable power accumulation that we fear.
