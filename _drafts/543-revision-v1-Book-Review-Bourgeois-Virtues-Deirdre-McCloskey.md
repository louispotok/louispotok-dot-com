[The Bourgeois Virtues](http://amzn.to/2fLX4pk) by Deirdre McCloskey

Bourgeois is a term of contempt or at least mild disdain among educated circles in the West. The bourgeois are the middle class, the merchant class, who must make their daily bread in the marketplace. This is not a new phenomenon on the earth and we find merchants in every civilization known to history. But the extent of the market has swallowed the earth over the last few hundred years and we are now most of us bourgeois. We live in the market; we are neither the peasants who long constituted most of human existence nor the aristocrats, feudal lords, or chieftains who for many long centuries stole their bread. [54% of humans](http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/news/population/world-urbanization-prospects-2014.html) and [63% of Americans](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2015/cb15-33.html) live in cities, whence the root &#8220;bourgeois&#8221;, like a _borough_ of New York or like Pitts_burgh._

Much of our lives are negotiations and exchanges: we trade time for money, money for housing and food and comforts. Maybe we try to buy widgets cheap and sell them dear.

But how does this system of exchange work? Does greed alone, mutual self-interest and utility-maximizing suffice to oil its wheels? And what becomes of our souls in such a milieu?

For a planet encircled by capitalism, and peopled by a species of ape that trucks and barters six days a week and worships on the seventh, these are crucial questions. And Dierdre McCloskey, in this first of five planned volumes, attempts to answer them.

McCloskey is a questing, learned scholar and a fine writer here producing her life&#8217;s major work,
