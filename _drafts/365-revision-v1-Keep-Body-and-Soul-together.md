My mom uses a very interesting expression sometimes. Here it is in its natural habitat:

> **Interlocuter:** When is dinner?
> 
> **Mom:**Not for another few hours. Why don&#8217;t you have a snack now **to keep body and soul together**?

I love this expression.

The literal meaning is: **in order not to die.** This saying packs a lot of worldview into a small suitcase!
