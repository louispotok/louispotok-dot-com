No, this post is not an advertisement for a new car only slightly different than last year&#8217;s edition.

**Premise 1**: Accelerating on a bicycle is hard&#8211;you have to pedal.

**Premise 2**: Accelerating in a car is easy&#8211;you just push your foot down lightly.

**Conclusion 1**: Compared to bicyclists, drivers don&#8217;t mind needless acceleration. What this also means for driving, where you have a route of fixed length, is that drivers don&#8217;t mind braking. [Hypermilers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy-efficient_driving#Acceleration_and_deceleration_.28braking.29) have already caught on, but for most drivers this is unintuitive.

For example, on a bicycle I will often slow down well ahead of a red light, so that I can coast slowly until it turns green. But when I drive, usually I will maintain my speed, stop at the light, and then re-accelerate from zero. Drivers start-and-stop more than necessary,Â especially in cities. I can&#8217;t find figures on this but the data would not be hard to gather.

**Solution**: Change the automobile interface to make acceleration difficult, like on a bicycle. You wouldn&#8217;t be powering the car, but you&#8217;d have to be pedaling for the car to go&#8211;and you could even make it harder to go uphill. You&#8217;d have to change the layout of the car a little bit, but technically I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s possible. This would make intuitive driving more efficient, because people are lazy, and would also be good for people&#8217;s health.
