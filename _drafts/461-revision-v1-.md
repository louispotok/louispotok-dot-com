Footnote 1 is full of killer ideas:

  * **The randomized response technique:**Â pick two questions was first developed in 1965 by Stanley Warner as a process in which a randomizing device such as a spinner would select one of two statements about a sensitive topic. The spinner would select one statement with known probability p and the other statement with probability 1-p. The respondent would then inform the surveyor whether or not she agreed with the selected statement, without disclosing which statement was selected by the spinner. Other indirect methods include the unrelated question technique, the forced alternative technique, and the bogus pipeline technique. In the unrelated question technique, respondents are asked to answer &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221; to one of two randomly selected questions: the sensitive question or a question with a known probability of a &#8220;yes&#8221; answer. In the forced alternative technique, the respondent is presented with a sensitive question and then uses a randomizing device to determine whether to respond &#8220;yes&#8221;, &#8220;no&#8221;, or to present her true response. The bogus pipeline technique tells respondents they are being monitored by a lie detector.
