> "In business, it's not what you know. It's *who* you know."

This is received wisdom, but what does it actually mean?

There are a few different possibilities:
1. You can only get what you want by asking people that you already have a personal relationship with.
1. You can get introductions from existing relationships to new relationships.

For (2), why does the introduction matter? So let's say `A <> B <> C` but `A <!> C` where `<>` means "knows" and `<!>` means doesn't know. So B is introducing A to C, at A's request.

Why does C talk to A?  Some possibilities:
1. To strengthen their relationship with B. They're doing B a favor, maybe they can call in the favor later. Or maybe they already owe B a favor. Anyway, it's about the relationship with B.
1. most people are not worth knowing. But C already thinks B is worth knowing, and B thinks A is worthknowing, so C trusts B's judgment at least enough to give them a look themselves. B is in some way vouching for A's quality by making the introduction. They have "a good reputation".

there's one more thing I didn't realize until it was pointed out to me last night.

In Indonesia, legal enforcement for contracts can be unreliable. Your recourse, shoudl a business relatinoship go sour, is to hurt that person's reputation. You can only do this if if you know people in common. A cold outrecah from A to C would leave C with no recourse. It's only when C has the option of huring A's repuration that they are willing to do business. Your mutual relationship with B is, in a sense, the collateral you are staking for your deal.
