We were falling back on violence because we weren&#8217;t creative enough or imaginative enough to find another solution, because we didn&#8217;tÂ _work_ hard enough (p 178)

&#8220;When we are really honest with ourselves, we must admit that our lives are all that really belong to us. So it is how we use our lives that determines what kind of men we are. It is my deepest belief that only by giving our lives do we find life. I am convinced that the truest act of courage, the strongest act of manliness, is to sacrifice ourselves for others in a totally nonviolent struggle for justice. To be a man is to suffer for others. God help us be men.&#8221; pp 195-196
