At my job, we give data science applicants a take home problem along the following lines:

> We run a store, and we are trying to increase the amount of time customers spend shopping. Every day at 3PM we give out fresh chocolate chip cookies. Does giving out cookies lead to customers spending more time in the store?

This problem is not trivial to solve, and I&#8217;ve seen a lot of people struggle with it. Sometimes after a lot of thought, they come up with convoluted analytical ideas. Following their logic &#8211; and knowing whether it&#8217;s correct &#8211; can be difficult.

So I wrote a short program that simulates this situation and generates fake data under a variety of assumptions, then I apply their analytic technique to the fake data.
