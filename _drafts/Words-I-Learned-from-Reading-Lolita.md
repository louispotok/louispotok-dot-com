_Solecism_: the nonstandard use of a grammatical construction, a violation of good manners. &#8220;Save for the correction of obvious solecisms&#8230;&#8221; (p. 3)

_Etiolated:_ weakened, no longer at full strength. (From botany:  whitened through lack of sunlight.) &#8220;situations and emotions that would remain exasperatingly vague had their expression been etiolated by means of platitudinous evasions.&#8221; (p. 4)

_Manqué: _Unfulfilled, having failed to live up to specific ambitions. &#8220;I planned to take a degree in psychiatry as many manqué talents do; but I was even more manqué than that.&#8221; (p. 15)

_Uranist_: Homosexual. (Nonstandard version of [uranian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranian). &#8220;Paris suited me. I discussed Soviet movies with expatriates. I sat with uranists in the Deux Magots.&#8221; (p. 16)

&nbsp;

_Remindful:_ I knew this meant &#8220;reminiscent&#8221;. But it&#8217;s a nice word to know, nonetheless. &#8220;[At] various institutions, such as orphanages, and reform schools, &#8230; pale pubescent girls with matted eyelashes could be stared at in perfect impunity remindful of that granted one in dreams.&#8221; (p. 16) __
