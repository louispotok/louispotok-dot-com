When I was in high school I was talking about my new girlfriend with a girl I had a serious crush on, a girl that I never really asked out. (More on this later.)

&#8220;Do you love her?&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;m a writer&#8211;I don&#8217;t use that word.&#8221; This was part true, and part just me trying to sound impressive.

&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221;

&#8220;It&#8217;s so vague and useless. Everyone means different things by it, and I&#8217;m not sure what I would mean by it.&#8221;

&#8220;Okay, but enough bullshitting: do you love her?&#8221;

Perhaps a formative moment of my life, being told that _love _as it usually meant is the only option, the only goal of note and any trying to root around in the meaning of it is just intellectual masturbation condemning me to nothing but physical masturbation [work on this phrasing].

&nbsp;

Ideal thing to say based on Radical Honesty. &#8220;I&#8217;m in love with you now. That gives you a strong chance of being the only person I love tomorrow, a majority shot at me being in love with you next week, and a plurality&#8211;if a narrow one&#8211;a year from now.&#8221;

I&#8217;m reading Against Love by Laura Kipnis&#8211;it is thought provoking, though less fun than I expected.
