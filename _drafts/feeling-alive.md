There are two very different experiences in which I feel "alive". 

One is passive - experiencing, feeling in tune with the universe. Great natural beauty makes me feel this way, meditation can trigger it, sometimes I am brought to tears just by seeing leaves glinting in the sun or a bird flash sharply overhead.

The second is active - when I have generative energy inside me, when I want to reach out and touch something in the world, do something.

They are in some ways opposite - the first involves my ego almost dissolving into the world around me, and the second is when I am a ball of pure ego, completely separated from what's outside - a being of agency in a malleable world. And yet they both make me feel so, so alive.
