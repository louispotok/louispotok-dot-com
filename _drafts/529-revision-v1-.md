hayek argued for decentralized capitalism as the only computationally tractable way to allocate resources across society.

is this still true?

Isn&#8217;t the vision of large corporations (railroad barons, Amazon and Google today) to gather all the information that they can to become centers of command and control for the economy?

how do we seize it back?
