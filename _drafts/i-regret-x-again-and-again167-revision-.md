&#8220;I never want to do X again. I&#8217;ve decided it before, but this time is different. This time I really mean it, I feel it so strongly, I&#8217;m definitely never doing X again.&#8221;

Two potential models of regret:

  1. <span style="line-height: 14px;"><strong>Hydraulic model of regret:</strong> regret builds up over time. The first time you regret doing X, you won&#8217;t stop doing it. But as the weight builds up over time, as you keep doing X, you start feeling more and more strongly that you <em>really should</em> quit. Eventually you feel so strongly that you just <em>stop, </em>out of willpower.<br /> </span>
  2.
