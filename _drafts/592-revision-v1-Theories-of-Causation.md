Who&#8217;s to blame?

I think most people have an intuition that blame can be divided up numerically. There is a certain amount of blame to go around, and you can split it up among everyone who is partially to blame. But at some point I realized this doesn&#8217;t quite work.

Here&#8217;s a motivating example. 



I&#8217;ve had this notion rattling around my brain for years: 

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large">
  <p>
    Causation doesn&#8217;t add up to 100%.
  </p>
</blockquote>

The same is true of blame. 

Here&#8217;s the motivating example: two people or years, been challenging simple causal notions with a simple example. Don&#8217;t know how to resolve. summary: &#8220;blame doesn&#8217;t add up to 100%&#8221;.

motivating example: two people in a room, fire breaks out. neither goes for the fire extinguisher. Who is responsible for it spreading? in one sense, each is 50% responsible. In another, each is 100% responsible.
