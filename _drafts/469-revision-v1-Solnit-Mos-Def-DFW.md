In [Hope in the Dark](http://amzn.to/2gWErBC) Rebecca Solnit calls for a complex, richly-textured middle ground between smooth optimism and flat pessimism. Neither provides the firm footing that an activist needs. A world that is all good doesn&#8217;t need to be changed, and progressives recognize this attitude as a dangerous foe. But it is easy to slip into the opposite, to see a world that is all bad, that cannot be changed, that is ruled entirely by malevolent forces. If you see the world this way you will never find the strength to fight.

Solnit describes instead a kind of hope that recognizes the good and bad in the world, an attitude leavened by an understanding of the complex histories that have brought us success and failure both.

But at base the idea is that

> Well, from my understanding people get better when they start to understand that they are valuable. And they&#8217;re not valuable because they&#8217;ve got a whole lot of money or because somebody thinks they&#8217;re sexy. But they&#8217;re valuable because they&#8217;ve been created by God. And God makes you valuable. But whether or not you recognize that value is one thing&#8230;.

> There is actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. And an outstanding reason for choosing some sort of God or spiritual-type thing to worship&#8230;is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive. If you worship money and things — if they are where you tap real meaning in life — then you will never have enough. Never feel you have enough. It&#8217;s the truth. Worship your own body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly, and when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally plant you&#8230; Worship power — you will feel weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to keep the fear at bay. Worship your intellect, being seen as smart — you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out. And so on.
