I think most people have an intuition that blame can be divided up numerically. There is a certain amount of blame to go around, and you can split it up among everyone who is partially to blame. But at some point I realized this doesn&#8217;t quite work.

Here&#8217;s a motivating example. Two people are in a room when a fire breaks out. There&#8217;s a fire extinguisher, but neither of them uses it. Instead they both run for the exit and get out safely, but the fire spreads and the whole building burns down. Who is to blame?



I&#8217;ve had this notion rattling around my brain for years: 

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large">
  <p>
    Causation doesn&#8217;t add up to 100%.
  </p>
</blockquote>

The same is true of blame. 

Here&#8217;s the motivating example: two people or years, been challenging simple causal notions with a simple example. Don&#8217;t know how to resolve. summary: &#8220;blame doesn&#8217;t add up to 100%&#8221;.

motivating example: two people in a room, fire breaks out. neither goes for the fire extinguisher. Who is responsible for it spreading? in one sense, each is 50% responsible. In another, each is 100% responsible.
