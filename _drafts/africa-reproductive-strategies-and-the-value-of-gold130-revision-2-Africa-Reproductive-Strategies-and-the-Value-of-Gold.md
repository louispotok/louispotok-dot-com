I&#8217;m partway through John Reader&#8217;s [Africa: A Biography of a Continent](http://www.amazon.com/Africa-Biography-Continent-John-Reader/dp/067973869X). I&#8217;ve been disappointed in some sections about science and economics, which I&#8217;ve found a little superficial or misleading. But the book is definitely worth a read if you have broad interests and I wanted to post about two new things that I&#8217;ve learned.

**Reproductive Strategies:**

> &#8220;Evolutionary biologists have grouped the ways of life which natural selection has favoured during the course of evolution into two broad categories: r- and K-strategies.
> 
> &#8230;**Organisms [with] r-strategies** &#8230; **are opportunists**, existing in minimal numbers for much of the time but able to increase rapidly and move on to colonize other regions when conditions permit&#8230;
> 
> **K-strategists** &#8230; occupy more predictable environments &#8230; [and] **seek equilibrium and stability.**&#8220;

It&#8217;s pretty easy to sort species into one group or the other, though again these are just broad groups. [[And interestingly it looks like this paradigm fell out of favor among evolutionary biologists i in the early 90&#8217;s while the book was published in &#8217;97, which confirms my suspicions about the writer&#8217;s scientific chops.]] The quintessential r-strategists are most insects, rodents, and weeds. Whales and elephants on the other hand are standard K-strategists: very few offspring, late reproductive age, long lifespan.
