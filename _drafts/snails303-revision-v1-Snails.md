I wrote this in an email to myself on December 28, 2013. Why?

> Every time someone comes to my apartment, they make fun of this one enormous painting on my wall. Itâ€™s two snails climbing a hill, done pretty clearly by a child. I found it next to a pile of trash on a beach in Tel Aviv and sat there for maybe 30 minutes using a butter knife to pry out all the staples connecting it to the wooden frame. Then I rolled it up and brought it home, all so my friends could make fun of it constantly. But something about it really speaks to me.

Edit: Josh Katz [points out](https://twitter.com/JoshHenryKatz/status/450960512768294912) that I later abandoned this painting back to the trash, on Bergen Street.
