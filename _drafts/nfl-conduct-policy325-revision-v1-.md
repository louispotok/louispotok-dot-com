Everything that&#8217;s wrong with the NFL can be found in its [Personal Conduct policy](http://images.nflplayers.com/mediaResources/files/2012%20Personal%20Conduct%20Policy.pdf). The league sees itself as the national religion, transcending common concerns of law and operating according to its own moral standards. In truth it is distinguished from a neighborhood cockfight only by its scale and hypocrisy.

**Example**: the league office is a [non-profit association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League#Corporate_structure) which in 2013 paid $0 in income tax but $45 million dollars in [salary and bonus](http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Closing-Bell/2014/02/14/Goodell.aspx) to its moronic commissioner. Individual teams also benefit enormously from [publicly-funded stadiums and tax breaks](http://www.npr.org/2014/01/18/263767372/the-nfl-big-business-with-big-tax-breaks). Maybe this why the conduct policy is frantically trying to preserve &#8220;public confidence in the National Football League.&#8221;
