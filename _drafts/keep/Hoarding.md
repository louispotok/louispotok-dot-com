If you anticipate a shortage of masks, what should you do? Let&#8217;s model this as a two-person game where each person can choose to stockpile or not.

  * If both stockpile, then both have enough for their supply and have small positive outcome.
  * If neither stockpile, then both have large negative outcome.
  * If A stockpiles, but B does not, then B buys a mask from A and gets 0 utils (assume A can price to exactly B&#8217;s willingness to pay). A gets a large positive outcome.

If we know the event (eg coronavirus outbreak) will occur, then it is obviously rational to stockpile.

But what about the case where the event is uncertain?

  * If the event happens, our analysis above holder.
  * If the event doesn&#8217;t happen, you don&#8217;t care what your neighbor does.
      * If you stockpiled, you have a negative outcome (cost of the stockpile).
      * If you didn&#8217;t, you have 0 utils.

Relevant factors:

  * cost of stockpiling
  * outcomes under the various situations
  * private belief about an event
