This is an complex and broad question but I want to talk about it in a clear and limited way, so let&#8217;s simplify a bit. Essentially when you look at old pictures, you are adding new memories to your brain. The effect on your happiness depends on how those new memories compare to the existing ones. My guess is that both the number of memories, and the ratio of good-to-bad, matters. So if you only had one memory, and it was unpleasant, getting a new bad memory would make you a little less happy, but getting a new good memory would make you much happier.

Now, which pieces of your life are you most likely to remember? This is going to sound stupid, but it&#8217;s the most memorable ones. You remember events&#8211;not nonevents. You remember the things that surprised you, the things that weren&#8217;t ordinary, the narratives that make good stories and not the day to day tedium that is the vast majority of your life. So if you were watching a live video of your life, you&#8217;d probably be surprised by how boring it was.[^1]. But your photos are selected twice, because first you have to choose to take them and then you have to choose to store them. So probably they are mostly pretty exciting.

If you look at a picture of a memory you the only thing that happens when you look at pictures is that Â How often does it make you feel better and how often does it make you feel worse? At base, the things we remember
