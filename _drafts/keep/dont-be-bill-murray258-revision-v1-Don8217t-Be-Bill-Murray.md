There&#8217;s a great line in [The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003QSGF0C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B003QSGF0C&linkCode=as2&tag=capilactio-20)Â  where Zissou [Bill Murray], an ocean explorer and documentary film-maker, is describing advances in deep-sea diving suits:

> Supposedly Cousteau and his cronies invented the idea of putting walkie-talkies into the helmet. But we made ours with a special rabbit ear on the top so we could pipe in some music.

I think this is a great metaphor for startups. Most new companies are adding rabbit ears and piping in music. Very few are the Cousteaus who are the first to put walkie-talkies into helmets.
