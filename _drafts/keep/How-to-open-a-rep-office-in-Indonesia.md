From IIPC email 21/05/22: 

> As you may aware, Indonesia will implement the risk-based business licensing started on 2 June 2021 to simplify the process, so that a low-risk business activity (including KPPA) will have much simpler requirements and procedures, different with a high-risk business activity. 
> 
> Prior to that, BKPM has issued BKPM Regulation 4/2021 on Guidelines and Procedures for Risk-Based Business Licensing Services and Investment Facilities. There is a slight change in the provisions on KPPA and simplification on the requirements based on the regulation (see attachment). Legalized LOI, LOA and LOS also LOR are still required.
