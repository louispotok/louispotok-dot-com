This is an complex and broad question but I want to talk about it in a clear and limited way, so let&#8217;s simplify a bit. Let&#8217;s say that when you look at old pictures, you are either adding new memories to storage or strengthening/intensifying existing ones Â The effect on your happiness depends on how those new memories compare to the existing ones. My guess is that both the number of memories, and the ratio of good-to-bad, matters. So if you only had one memory, and it was unpleasant, getting a new bad memory would make you a little less happy, but getting a new good memory would make you much happier.

Now, which pieces of your life are you most likely to remember? This is going to sound stupid, but it&#8217;s the most memorable ones. You remember events&#8211;not nonevents. You remember the things that surprised you, the things that weren&#8217;t ordinary, the narratives that make good stories and not the day to day tedium that is the vast majority of your life (unless you are [this guy](http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/sunherald/obituary.aspx?n=harry-stamps&pid=163538353&fhid=4025#fbLoggedOut)). So if you were watching a live video of your life, you&#8217;d probably be surprised by how boring it was.[^1] But your photos go through two screenings: first you have to choose to take them, and then you have to choose to store them. So probably they are mostly pretty exciting.

[^1]: And by how different your hair looks from over here.

So how do your photographs stack up to your current &#8220;stack&#8221; or backlog of memories? They are more exciting.
