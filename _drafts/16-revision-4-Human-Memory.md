There are two closely related intuitions that lead us astray when it comes to designing technology. The general one is that more&#8211;size, speed, capacity, choice&#8211;is always better. (Is this a universal human tendency or just late capitalism?) And, specifically, the most important dimensions are those in which we feel we ourselves need to improve (this is marginal vs. absolute thinking).

<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Sometimes, though, we find that we had the right solution all along. We thought that the problem with humans is too much emotion, not enough cognition. So when we are designing fake humans (robots), we build them without emotions. Donald Norman, in Emotional Design, suggests that we do the opposite both because it will be important for us to relate to and also because it will make them more effective (coffeepot example). We should start thinking the same way about memory. It is very important, for social relationships to function, for memory to be on the same level among participants. So our machines should forget things like we do. moreover memory is like attention: there are many possible things to &#8220;remember&#8221; = take into account, so need some way to prioritize/subset.</span>
