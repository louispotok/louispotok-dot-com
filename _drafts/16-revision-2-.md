We build technological objects to have capacities that we ourselves lack. Sometimes, though, we find that we had the right solution all along. We thought that the problem with humans is too much emotion, not enough cognition. So when we are designing fake humans (robots), we build them without emotions. Donald Norman, in Emotional Design, suggests that we do the opposite both because it will be important for us to relate to and also because it will make them more effective (coffeepot example). We should start thinking the same way about memory. It is very important, for social relationships to function, for memory to be on the same level among participants. So our machines should forget things like we do.
