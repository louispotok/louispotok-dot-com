A friend just asked me for book recommendations and this is my favorite request in the world. Here goes, some books I&#8217;ve read and loved lately:

  1. [Code: The Hidden Life of Computer Hardware and Software]("http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735611319/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0735611319&linkCode=as2&tag=capilactio-20): Oh, so that&#8217;s how it works! If you&#8217;ve never written any code &#8212; and I would rate my experience as pretty rudimentary outside of Stata &#8212; large parts of how your life is governed are inexplicable to you. This book goes one level deeper, showing how computers &#8220;translate&#8221; between all that binary and the software we know and love.
  2. [Understanding Power: The Indispensable Chomsky](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1565847032/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1565847032&linkCode=as2&tag=capilactio-20): I was surprised at how non-technical I found this. I found myself disturbed by his claims and provoked to thought even when I disagreed. Chomsky&#8217;s is a very useful voice to have in your head, even if only as a devil&#8217;s advocate. And he comes across as much more humble in this book than I was expecting. He often repeats that any eighth grader could ask the same questions he does, and people only listen to him more because of his unrelated achievements in linguistics.
  3. [Metaphors We Live By:](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226468011/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0226468011&linkCode=as2&tag=capilactio-20) This book really _deepens_ your understanding of how all our language &#8212; all our thought! &#8212; is _composed_ of some really _fundamental_ metaphors that _sit_ right _below_ our consciousness. And it&#8217;s _full_ of fun examples for those who love _little_ language lessons.
  4. [Table of Contents](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374520089/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0374520089&linkCode=as2&tag=capilactio-20): A hilarious title for a book made up of short pieces. If you love science, history, America, infrastructure, geology, engineering, heavy transportation, New Jersey forest rangers, etc, you owe it to yourself to read all the John McPhee you can get your hands on. Start with [Atchafalaya](http://t.co/PH0P930j10) if you&#8217;re unsure.
  5. [American Gods](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062080237/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0062080237&linkCode=as2&tag=capilactio-20): Fun fun fun. Deep, mythological, &#8220;spiritual&#8221;, whatever. The scene where &#8220;Wednesday&#8221; yells at the San Francisco waitress about how she&#8217;s a bad pagan&#8230;oh man.
  6. [Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393082067/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0393082067&linkCode=as2&tag=capilactio-20): Of all these books this is the closest to my expertise, but I still learned so much &#8212; annotated every other page &#8212; want to reread it till I know it by heart. What could be more important than tools for thinking? And what subjects more interesting to practice on than free will, consciousness, AI and evolution?
