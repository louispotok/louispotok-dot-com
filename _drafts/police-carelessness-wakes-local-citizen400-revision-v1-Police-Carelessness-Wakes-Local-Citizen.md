Tuesday morning I was woken up at 5AM by a police siren. As I lay awake, I started thinking. I couldn&#8217;t be the only one woken up. Should police cars use their sirens at night? It seems like a classic example of diffuse costs and easy-to-see benefits. But is it worth it? Let&#8217;s make a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation.

The cost of running a siren at night can be modeled by the following equation (I love Fermi problems!):```<br />
LengthDriven * (2 * SirenDistance) * Density * PctWoken *<br />
DailyIncome * ProductivityLoss<br />
` 

where:

  * we start with the _LengthDriven_ with the siren on
  * multiply by twice the _SirenDistance,_ how far away on each side of the police car a person can hear the siren, to get the geographic area affected
  * multiply by the _Density_ to get the number of people potentially affected
  * multiply by the _PctWoken_ to get the number of people who were woken up
  * multiply by the average _DailyIncome_ to see how much economic value those people create each day
  * multiply by the _ProductivityLoss_ (as a percent) that they experience when groggy to see how much economic value was lost by the siren

This model makes some assumptions. It assumes the police car drives in a straight line, that the density is uniform, that the _PctWoken_ is constant within theÂ _SirenDistance_ and zero outside of it, that everyone works (so ignoring children), that everyone works a day shift, that the _ProductivityLoss_ is independent of _DailyIncome,_ etc. But it seems like a reasonable first step.

Let&#8217;s plug in some values:

_LengthDriven_ = 0.25 miles

_SirenDistance_ = 400 feet \approx 0.08 miles

_Density_ = 18,187 people/square mile in SF (from [Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco)

_PctWoken_ = 5% of people. I made this up out of nowhere.

_DailyIncome_ = $45000 [yearly per-capita income in SF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco#cite_note-2014CensusEst-21) / 200 work days per year = $225 per day

_ProductivityLoss_ = 25%, I made this up too

This gives us an economic cost of **$1023 every time a police officer flips a siren on at night.**

Even if this only happens once per night in SF, it creates a cost of $375,000 over the course of the year &#8212; equivalent to the salary of about 4 police officers, or about 1% of the SFPD&#8217;s budget. Use of sirens also appears to be [dangerous.](http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Limiting-cars-lights-siren-use-may-prevent-2808754.php) I wonder what the benefits are &#8212; how much additional public safety is provided for this cost?

I reached out to the SFPD asking if they have any guidelines about siren use &#8212; stay tuned.
