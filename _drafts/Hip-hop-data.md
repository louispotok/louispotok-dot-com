Yasiin Bey (formerly known as Mos Def) has an amazing rant on his song [Fear Not of Man](http://genius.com/Yasiin-bey-fear-not-of-man-lyrics):  
Listen.. people be askin me all the time  
&#8220;Yo Mos, what&#8217;s gettin ready to happen with Hip-Hop?&#8221;  
(Where do you think Hip-Hop is goin?)  
I tell em, &#8220;You know what&#8217;s gonna happen with Hip-Hop?  
Whatever&#8217;s happening with us&#8221;  
If we smoked out, Hip-Hop is gonna be smoked out  
If we doin alright, Hip-Hop is gonna be doin alright  
People talk about Hip-Hop like it&#8217;s some giant livin in the hillside  
Comin down to visit the townspeople  
We are Hip-Hop  
Me, you, everybody, we are Hip-Hop  
So Hip-Hop is going where we going  
So the next time you ask yourself where Hip-Hop is going  
Ask yourself: where am I going? How am I doing?  
&#8217;til you get a clear idea  
So.. if Hip-Hop is about the people  
And the.. Hip-Hop won&#8217;t get better until the people get better  
Then how do people get better? (Hmmmm&#8230;)
