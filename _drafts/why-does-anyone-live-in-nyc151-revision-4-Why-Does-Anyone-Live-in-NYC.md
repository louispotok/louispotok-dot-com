What is it about snakes that makes people so jumpy and uncomfortable? There seem to be certain long-held and deeply human instincts, and Donald Norman&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Emotional-Design-Love-Everyday-Things/dp/0465051367" target="_blank">Emotional Design</a> (pp. 29-30) discusses how we can use these immediate affective responses&#8211;good and bad&#8211;into our design. (<a title="Should Robots Have Emotions?" href="http://louispotok.com/should-robots-have-emotions/" target="_blank">A previous post about Emotional Design</a>)

What are the situations that trigger positive affect?

> warm, comfortably lit places
> 
> temperate climate
> 
> sweet tastes and smells
> 
> bright, highly saturated hues
> 
> &#8220;soothing&#8221; sounds and simple melodies and rhythms
> 
> harmonious music and sounds
> 
> caresses
> 
> smiling faces
> 
> rhythmic beats
> 
> &#8220;attractive&#8221; people
> 
> symmetrical objects
> 
> rounded, smooth objects
> 
> &#8220;sensous feelings, sounds and shapes.

Meanwhile, the conditions that &#8220;appear to produce automatic negative affect&#8221;:

> heights
> 
> sudden, unexpected loud sounds or bright lights
> 
> &#8220;looming&#8221; objects (objects that appear to be about to hit the observer)
> 
> extreme hot or cold
> 
> darkness
> 
> extremely bright lights or loud sounds
> 
> empty, flat terrain (deserts)
> 
> crowded dense terrain (jungles or forests)
> 
> crowds of people
> 
> rotting smells, decaying foods
> 
> bitter tastes
> 
> sharp objects
> 
> harsh, abrupt sounds
> 
> grating and discordant sounds
> 
> misshapen human bodies
> 
> snakes and spiders
> 
> human feces (and its smell)
> 
> other people&#8217;s body fluids
> 
> vomit.

Since I live in New York, I experience a lot of these latter triggers regularly. Can cities be designed to minimize these problems?
