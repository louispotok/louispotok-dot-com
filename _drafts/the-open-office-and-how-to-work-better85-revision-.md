The [open office plan](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21878739) is older than you think:

> In the spring of 1962, a fourth-year British architectural student &#8230;<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"> stumbled across a small article in a trade magazine about a new workplace design that had taken hold in Germany&#8230;as &#8220;fundamentally a reaction against Nazism&#8221;.</span>
