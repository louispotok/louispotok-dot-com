In <a title="Why (Behavioral) Science Matters" href="http://louispotok.com/why-behavioral-science-matters/" target="_blank">my previous post</a> I railed against a political fundraising technique I saw in the wild (on Twitter). I was upset because the experimental literature suggested that the technique they used was a waste of money, and I went on to lament the campaign&#8217;s lack of interest in science.

But it&#8217;s possible they were a step ahead of me. After all, a _true_ science-driven campaign would be doing their own experimenting because of external validity concerns in the paper I mentioned. So maybe I was just in one of several treatment groups. If that&#8217;s the case I hope they&#8217;re tracking &#8220;disdainful blog posts&#8221; as an outcome variable of interest.
