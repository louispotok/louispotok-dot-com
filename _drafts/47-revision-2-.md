When I was in high school I was talking about my new girlfriend with a girl I had a serious crush on, a girl that I never really asked out. (More on this later.)

&#8220;Do you love her?&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;m a writer&#8211;I don&#8217;t use that word.&#8221;

&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;m in love with you now. That gives you a strong chance of being the only person I love tomorrow, a majority shot at me being in love with you next week, and a plurality&#8211;if a narrow one&#8211;a year from now.&#8221;

I&#8217;m reading Against Love by Laura Kipnis&#8211;it is thought provoking, though less fun than I expected.
