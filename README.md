TODO:
* replace "wp-content" -- how much?
* make a favicon
* do i need these "id=" tags in the front matter?
* Use netlify instead of gh-pages?
* Write excerpts for every post and show them.
* comments? netlify forms like gleech?
* auto updated https://stackoverflow.com/a/33721446/3393459 eg for /now page.
* Auto redirects through https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from? combo with JFM perhaps
  * Also note: the URLs are different, your nb-blog urls are `YYYY/MM/DD/something-something.html` and your other posts are just `something/`
* Accordion troubleshooting:
  * Verbose: Try writing a tag / new plugin for accordions
  * I should be able to get markdown to work inside the accordions, right? why isn't it working?
  * Similarly how do I get multiple paragraphs?
* history widget pulling from wrong repo

Notes:
* where is the theme to customize? Run `bundle info {themename}`
* Used jquery-ui custom downloader for accordion.
