TODO:
* replace "wp-content" -- how much?
* make a favicon
* do i need these "id=" tags in the front matter?
* Write excerpts for every post and show them (using `summary`).
* auto updated https://stackoverflow.com/a/33721446/3393459 eg for /now page.
* Auto redirects through https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from? combo with JFM perhaps
  * Also note: the URLs are different, your nb-blog urls are `YYYY/MM/DD/something-something.html` and your other posts are just `something/`
* Accordion troubleshooting:
  * Verbose: Try writing a tag / new plugin for accordions
  * I should be able to get markdown to work inside the accordions, right? why isn't it working?
  * Similarly how do I get multiple paragraphs?
* history widget pulling from wrong repo
* many links are still <a> tags, fix?
* Finish cleaning up wp_migrate tags?
* Better pagelist on about page and "quality" tags for "best posts" on home.
* quotebacks doesn't work inside accordion: head->desk
* check if I had any subscribers on Mailchimp (need SMS 2FA)
* twitter embed? see /whiteness
* file hosting outside git?
* sidenotes: https://www.gwern.net/Sidenotes

Notes:
* where is the theme to customize? Run `bundle info {themename}`
* Used jquery-ui custom downloader for accordion.
