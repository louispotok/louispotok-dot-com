**Last update**: 2021/08/31. This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about).

## Building [Recoolit](https://recoolit.com).

I'm the founder of an early-stage startup trying to prevent gigatons of CO2-equivalent emissions. The basic approach is to pay AC technicians in lower-income countries to recover superpotent greenhouse gases from end-of-life cooling devices. This gets tracked through software, and generates carbon offsets which are sold to American companies.

If you want to follow along, I intend to send out email updates through [this list](https://buttondown.email/recoolit).

## Living in Jakarta

I moved to Jakarta to work on Recoolit in May 2021. I hope to be here 1-3 years and I'm looking to make friends. If you live here, have friends here, or are just passing through, please [get in touch]({{site.baseurl}}#contact-me).

## Misc

Some other ongoing projects:
* Studying [Indonesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_language) by taking private lessons and using [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).
* Reading books about Indonesia and by Indonesian authors. Looking for recommendations!
* Bouldering (v3-v4).

I also consider myself a member of [The Data Guild](https://www.thedataguild.com/) and [My Climate Journey](https://www.myclimatejourney.co/) communities.
