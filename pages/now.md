## Building Recoolit.

I'm the cofounder and CEO of [Recoolit](https://recoolit.com), an early-stage startup preventing climate change. We keep super-potent greenhouse gases (refrigerants) out of the atmosphere, and sell carbon credits. Check out our website or [sign up for email updates](https://buttondown.email/recoolit).

## Living in Jakarta

I moved to Jakarta to work on Recoolit in May 2021 and always looking to make friends! If you live here, have friends here, or are just passing through, please [get in touch]({{site.baseurl}}#contact-me). I also spend some time in New York City and San Francisco.
