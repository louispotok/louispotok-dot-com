**Last update**: 2023/06/01. This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about).

## Building Recoolit.

I'm the founder of [Recoolit](https://recoolit.com), an early-stage startup preventing climate change. We keep super-potent greenhouse gases (refrigerants) out of the atmosphere, and sell carbon credits. Check out our website or [sign up for email updates](https://buttondown.email/recoolit).

## Living in Jakarta

I moved to Jakarta to work on Recoolit in May 2021 and always looking to make friends! If you live here, have friends here, or are just passing through, please [get in touch]({{site.baseurl}}#contact-me).

## Misc

Some other ongoing projects:
* Studying [Indonesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_language) by taking private lessons and using [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).
* Reading books about Indonesia and by Indonesian authors. Looking for recommendations!
* Bouldering (v3-v4).
* Playing ultimate frisbee (pickup).

I also consider myself a member of [The Data Guild](https://www.thedataguild.com/) and [My Climate Journey](https://www.myclimatejourney.co/) communities.
