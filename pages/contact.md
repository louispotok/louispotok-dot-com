You can reach me by [email](mailto:{{site.email}}) or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/louispotok). My Twitter DMs are open, but I believe Twitter imposed restrictions on DMs in late 2023. I also have a Linkedin account, where I only accept requests from people I've met.

I love getting messages from friendly strangers, so don't be shy. Feel free to:
* Tell me if you had a strong reaction, positive or negative, to something I wrote.
* Ask me a favor -- I'll gladly help if I can.
* Tell me what you're working on and why you're passionate about it.
* Ask for advice.
* Send or request reading suggestions, especially related to my [open questions]({{site.baseurl}}{% link pages/questions.md %}).
