> A whole canefield of words has grown up between La Maga and me, we have only been separated by a few hours and my sorrow is already **called** sorrow, and my love is **_called_** love. . . I shall keep on feeling less and less and remembering more and more, but what is memory if not the language of feeling, a dictionary of faces and days and smells which repeat themselves like the verbs and adjectives in a speech, sneaking in behind the thing itself, into the pure present. . .
