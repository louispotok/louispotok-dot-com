We understand our lives in terms of stories. Storytelling forms a key part of persuasion of ourselves and others. Our memories, our whole life regard, comes down to the stories we tell and the roles we play in them.

David Mamet is a master storyteller, and a few years ago as he was working on a tv show called The Unit he got frustrated with the screenwriters. He wrote them [this memo](https://wordswordswords.quora.com/David-Mamet-on-Dramatic-Writing) outlining what they did wrong and one piece of key advice:
> Question: what is drama? Drama, again, is the quest of the hero to overcome those things which prevent him from achieving a specific, acute goal.
> 
> So: we, the writers, must ask ourselves of every scene these three questions:
> 
> 1) Who wants what?
> 
> 2) What happens if they don't get it?
> 
> 3) Why now?

I return to this advice often in a variety of situations and it has rarely steered me wrong. Some of what follows is obvious - other parts may be more surprising.

1. Persuasion
2. Storytelling for entertainment
3. Following my own urges -- accentuating them - both for living-in-the-moment enjoyment AND storytelling
4. Encouraging the urges of others

Quotes from 3 uses:
> It is difficult, finally, **not** to see our lives as a play with ourselves the hero.

> That which the hero requires **is** the play. In the perfect play we find nothing extraneous to his or her single desire. Every incident either impedes or aids the hero/heroine in the quest for the single goal.

> As the audience has pledged or loaned its attention, it is easy to interject the extraneous -- an audience will accept it asa essential until that point at which it has been proved otherwise

(cf priya parker - guests loan hosts power.)

> In the middle term the high-minded goal has devolved into what seems to be quotidian, mechanical and ordinary drudgery: now we are not trying to establish the Jewish Homeland but negotiating a contract with a stationer to supply the paper so that we may write fund-raising letters.
> Now we are not trying to determine how to live in a world bereft of our father; we are trying to dispatch two impertinent toadies named Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

> Artists don't wonder "what is it good for?" they aren't driven to "create art" or to "help people" or to "make money". They are driven to lessen the burden of the unbearable disparity between their conscious and unconscious minds, and so to achieve peace.

> In suspending their disbelief -- in suspending their reason, if you will -- for a moment, the viewers were rewarded. They committed an act of faith, or of submission. And like those who rise refreshed from prayers, their prayers were answered. For the purpose of the prayer was not, finally, to bring about intercession in the material world but to lay down, for the time of the prayer, one's confusion and rage and sorrow at one's own powerlessness.

> (by definition a character in a drama is engaged in an exacting pursuit -- Aristotle says the character **is** the pursuit)
