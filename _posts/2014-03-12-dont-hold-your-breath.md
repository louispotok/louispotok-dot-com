Our ape-brains boggle at the vastness of time.

> &#8220;At 15:30:08 UTC on Sun, 4 December 292,277,026,596 64-bit versions of the Unix time stamp will cease to work, as it will overflow th_e largest value that can be held in a signed 64-bit number. This is not anticipated to pose a problem, as this is considerably longer than the time it would take the Sun to theoretically expand to a red giant and swallow the Earth.&#8221; ([From Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time))_

Reminds me of a great quote from [this interview](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/03/were-underestimating-the-risk-of-human-extinction/253821/):
