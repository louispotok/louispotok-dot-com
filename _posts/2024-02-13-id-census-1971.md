title: Indonesian Census 1971
summary: 
---

I was pleasantly surprised to discover the Indonesian National Bureau of Statistics has a [decent website](https://www.bps.go.id/id) with a pretty good open data portal.

I was looking for the population timeseries of a particular town and couldn't find it, but I did dig up a scanned version of the 1971 census, which you can find [here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/pdf/id-census-1971.pdf). I've probably looked at more printed tables of demographic statistics than most people. When I worked at the [CPE](https://web.archive.org/web/20140116023258/http://www.cpe.uchicago.edu/) I scanned and entered many such reports from US cities in the period 1860-1930. It's now close to trivial to convert this to another format using machine learning -- how long until all such PDFs become obsolete?
