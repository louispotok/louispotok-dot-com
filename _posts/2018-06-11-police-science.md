Very much enjoying Jackie Wang&#8217;s [Carceral Capitalism.](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/carceral-capitalism)

Especially liked this thought in &#8220;[This Is A Story About Nerds and Cops](https://www.e-flux.com/journal/87/169043/this-is-a-story-about-nerds-and-cops-predpol-and-algorithmic-policing/)&#8220;:

> Given that critics of the police associate law enforcement with the arbitrary use of force, racial domination, and the discretionary power to make decisions about who will live and who will die, the rebranding of policing in a way that foregrounds statistical impersonality and symbolically removes the agency of individual officers is a clever way to cast police activity as neutral, unbiased, and rational.
