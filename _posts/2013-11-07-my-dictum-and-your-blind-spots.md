In [Thinking Fast and Slow](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374275637/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0374275637&linkCode=as2&tag=capilactio-20) (one of my [5 behavioral economics must-reads](http://louispotok.com/5-easy-steps-to-becoming-louis/ "5 Easy Steps To Becoming Louis Potok")), Kahneman lays out the memorable idea that &#8220;What You See Is All There Is.&#8221; He explains it nicely in [a brief interview](http://www.apa.org/monitor/2012/02/conclusions.aspx):

> WYSIATI means that we use the information we have as if it is the only information. We don&#8217;t spend much time saying, &#8220;Well, there is much we don&#8217;t know.&#8221;

These are the famous [unknown unknowns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns) that I&#8217;ve [written about](http://louispotok.com/mathematical-decision-making/ "Mathematical Decision-Making")&#8212; the gaps or blind spots you wouldn&#8217;t think to look for. These are so important that I think it&#8217;s worth updating Asimov&#8217;s Dictum: &#8220;The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not &#8220;eureka!&#8221; but &#8220;that&#8217;s interesting&#8230;&#8221; &#8220;Similarly, **Potok&#8217;s Dictum** is that whenever you&#8217;re planning, evaluating, or decision-making:

> The most exciting phrase that heralds good decision-making is not &#8220;here&#8217;s the answer&#8221; but &#8220;oh, I hadn&#8217;t thought of that.&#8221;

Whenever a new idea, perspective, or fact appears, treat it carefully and [feed your inner pigeon](http://rationality.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/checklist_of_rationality_habits.pdf) so that you learn to keep generating them! A useful addition to your cognitive toolkit would be a set of ways to _find _those blindspots you would otherwise totally ignore. Here are a few I&#8217;ve thought of or seen elsewhere:

  1. **Explain it to a [child](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/)**
  2. **Ask a third party** with &#8220;middle-level&#8221; knowledge of the issue: not an expert, but not a child.
  3. **Find a new taxonomy** to organize everything you know about the issue &#8212; the &#8220;worse&#8221; it seems, the better. For example, if you&#8217;re planning a project chronologically, try to list all the aspects of the project by department or division instead.
  4. **Perform a [premortem](http://hbr.org/2007/09/performing-a-project-premortem):** ask yourself &#8220;If this project fails spectacularly, what will have caused it?&#8221;
  5. **Twiddle the knobs** a la Daniel Dennett&#8217;s [must-read advice about Intuition Pumps](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393082067/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0393082067&linkCode=as2&tag=capilactio-20), or Polya&#8217;s [guidelines for understanding mathematics](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/4871878317/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=4871878317&linkCode=as2&tag=capilactio-20). Change each part of what you know &#8212; sometimes the extreme cases &#8212; to see what happens. &#8220;What if we had 10 years to do this? What if we only had three days?&#8221; &#8220;What if only 5 people show up to our event? What about 50, or 500, or 5,000?&#8221; Most of these questions will be a waste of time but a few might completely change the way you&#8217;ve been thinking.

Readers: how do you find blind spots? What tools should I add to this list? Have you ever _completely_ overlooked something that was obvious in retrospect?
