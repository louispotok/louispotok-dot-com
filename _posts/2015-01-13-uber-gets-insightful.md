This is an interesting dataset for an urban planner. And Uber did well to anonymize to ZCTA instead of giving individual addresses.[1](#footnote_0_355 "Though some interesting data is lost here. For example, is the rider&rsquo;s destination on a busy avenue (to a store/restaurant) or a residential street (personal visit)?"){#identifier_0_355.footnote-link.footnote-identifier-link} NYC made <a href="https://medium.com/@vijayp/of-taxis-and-rainbows-f6bc289679a1" target="_blank">a mess of things</a> in June 2014 when trying to do something similar.

But using Uber&#8217;s data to actually make decisions is ludicrous. Urban planning, like most policymaking, is about how to best distribute scarce resources. It is _political_. Look at Uber&#8217;s example uses:

<div style="width: 576px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <img loading="lazy" class="" src="https://blog.uber.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/uber_SafeCities_BlogInfographic.png" alt="" width="566" height="974" />
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    Uber&#8217;s transportation policy
  </p>
</div>

If Boston actually uses Uber&#8217;s data to decide which potholes to fill first, they are not going to fill many potholes in poor neighborhoods. If Boston uses Uber&#8217;s data to add additional metro stops, they will not add metro stops in poor neighborhoods.

The first questions any data analyst should ask with a new dataset are:

  1. How was this data collected?
  2. What are its blind spots?

And the blind spots here are both large and systematic. Note, however, Uber&#8217;s vacuous language above: this data will provide &#8220;insights&#8221;. They are too smart to say explicitly &#8220;this is the only data source you should use for your city planning.&#8221; But without a similarly rich dataset on the whole city, the data will only provide &#8220;insights&#8221; about how to help rich folks.

And, by the way, be wary of people peddling insights. If an insight held up to rigorous analysis, we would just call it a conclusion.

**What do you think about Uber&#8217;s influence on urban policy?**
