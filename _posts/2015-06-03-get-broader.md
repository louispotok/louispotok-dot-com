Convene five of your friends who collectively have some expertise in each of the following:

  * Physics
  * Chemistry
  * Medicine
  * International Politics*
  * Literature
  * Economics

Every two months, read one book / paper by each of that year&#8217;s Nobelists.Â  Meet and discuss. Make the economist wear a special badge.

*For the peace prize, of course. I couldn&#8217;t figure out what it means to be an expert in peace.
