title: Regarding the name of this blog
summary: Ideas diffuse like blood, across a pressure gradient.
---

I named this blog in 2013 without giving it much thought. In 2021 I thought about it, and realized I liked it. Here's the explanation I wrote at the time:

> Capillary action is the process by which a liquid diffuses through a series of small tubes ("capillaries"), moving as though of its own accord and often against gravity.
> 
> In your body, it's how blood gets from veins and arteries through the much smaller capillaries into your cells. If you've ever dipped the corner of a paper towel into some coffee, you can see it at work as well.
> 
> **Ideas too seem to spread of their own volition through innumerable tiny channels until they suffuse the whole medium.**
> 
> There was also [a band with the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary_Action_(band)), but I am not affiliated with them.
