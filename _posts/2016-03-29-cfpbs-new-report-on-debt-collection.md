I wrote a twitter thread about the CFPB's [2016 Annual Report on the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act](https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201603_cfpb-fair-debt-collection-practices-act.pdf). Click through to see the whole thread.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">most debt in collections is from fin. services (e.g. loans). Not surprising. But whoa! telecoms is in second (22%) <a href="https://t.co/6OJKWIs82D">pic.twitter.com/6OJKWIs82D</a></p>&mdash; Louis Potok (@louispotok) <a href="https://twitter.com/louispotok/status/714900865782394880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 29, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

(This was originally a Storify embed, but Storify closed down in 2018. Another good reminder about relying on external services!)
