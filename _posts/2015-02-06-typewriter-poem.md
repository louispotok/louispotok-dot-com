This is a poem I wrote months ago on a scrap of brown paper grocery bag, on the hood of a stranger&#8217;s car parked on Paris Street in San Francisco:

> Any poem can sit unfinished in a typewriter for hours,  
> days.  
> Sometimes you wait for the next word to strike.  
> Sometimes you sit down and think,  
> hard,  
> about what to do next.

The back of this scrap of paper has the name [Michel Bouquet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Bouquet), who I saw in the film [Manon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manon_%28film%29). I don&#8217;t remember why I wrote down his name.

P.S. a good find from the forementioned open mic is filmmaker [Arthur Valverde](http://www.arthurvalverde.com/). I especially liked [this film](http://vimeo.com/60396742).
