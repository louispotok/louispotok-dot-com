At my hotel in Kuala Lumpur you can&#8217;t just take the elevator to your floor. I checked in and then stood in the elevator jamming on my button, surprised that it wasn&#8217;t lighting up. Ah&#8211;I noticed&#8211;I had to insert my key card into a little slot and only then press the button &#8212; it lit up, I felt a little frisson of reward and was on my way. Presumably the apparatus is necessary for &#8220;security reasons&#8221;. A little inconvenient &#8212; no big deal.

But here&#8217;s the rub: you can&#8217;t access any other floor using your key card. My colleague is staying on a different floor and _I can&#8217;t take the elevator to her room_. Presumably if we want to meet in her room we&#8217;re supposed to meet in the lobby and then together go up to her room, in some low level cryptographic metaphor. I assume this is meant to prevent unauthorized entry and skulking around. But instead I took the fire stairs two floors up. Problem solved
