I spent the weekend at a conference about the use of statistical analysis in sports decision-making. Among other things, we talked about player evaluation, the role of randomness, in-game coaching decisions, and optimal risk taking based on game situation. All of these through the lens of using data to improve how we act.

Just now I went to the grocery store wearing flip-flops: &#8220;oh, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s that cold outside.&#8221; Turns out it&#8217;s 34 degrees.

You can lead a horse to water, but sometimes he forgets to drink.
