I was flipping through the [Kama Sutra](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0600623211/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0600623211&linkCode=as2&tag=capilactio-20) yesterday and turns out to be much more than a sex manual! It&#8217;s a guide to etiquette and custom in many areas of life and offers really interesting glimpses into a culture very different from ours. Though some of it is practically timeless, for example:

> The following are the kinds of friends:
> 
>   * One who has played with you in the dust, i.e. in the childhood
>   * One who is bound by an obligation
>   * One who is of the same disposition and fond of the same things
>   * One who is a fellow student
>   * One who is acquainted with your secrets and faults and who&#8217;s faults and secrets are also known to you
>   * One who is a child of your nurse
>   * One who&#8217;s brought up with you
>   * One who is a hereditary friend

I hadn&#8217;t realized, but it&#8217;s also very Talmudic in its approach.

  * Here is the rule or custom.
  * The followers of X add an interpretation.
  * The followers of Y disagree.
  * [a digression about the theory and history of the legal principle used by the followers of Y.]

Highly recommended. The edition linked above is especially nice and uses the Richard Burton translation &#8212; I&#8217;ve also enjoyed Burton&#8217;s translation of the [Arabian Nights](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375756752/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0375756752&linkCode=as2&tag=capilactio-20) which is a book you can dip into again and again as you please, all through your life. [John Barth is a big fan of the Arabian Nights as well.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0399129979/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0399129979&linkCode=as2&tag=capilactio-20)
