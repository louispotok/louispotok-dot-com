Did you know there is a genre of music called &#8220;deep soul&#8221;? The [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_soul) explains &#8220;The focus of the music was not on its lyrics, but on the &#8220;feel&#8221; or the [groove](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groove_(music) "Groove (music)").&#8221;



The guy who uploaded this has given similar treatment to many of his other records. I know what I&#8217;ll be listening to at work today.
