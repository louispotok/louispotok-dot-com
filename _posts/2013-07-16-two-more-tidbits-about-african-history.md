From my notes about [John Reader's Africa](http://www.amazon.com/Africa-Biography-Continent-John-Reader/dp/067973869X), two fascinating and poetic tidbits to go along with my two previous posts [Annals of Comparative Advantage]({% link _posts/2013-05-12-annals-of-comparative-advantage.md %}) and [Africa: Reproductive Strategies and the Value of Gold]({% link _posts/2013-05-11-africa-reproductive-strategies-and-the-value-of-gold.md %}).

  1. <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Vasco da Gama, famous Portuguese explorer, would never have finished his voyage were it not for the helpful intercession of Ahmad Ibn-Madjid, &#8220;the most famous Arab pilot of his day&#8221;. However, Da Gama&#8217;s &#8220;arrival inaugurated an age of European maritime power in the [Indian Ocean] region&#8230;fellow-countrymen and co-religionists [of Ibn-Madjid] cursed his memory; and in his old age, Ibn-Madjid himself bitterly regretted what he had done.&#8221; (359)</span>
  2. <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">An earlier Portuguese voyage led by Bartolomeu Dias brought along six previously-captured African slaves to be dropped along the coastline as scouts for the location of raw materials. However, &#8220;the fate of the Africans who had been set ashore, dressed in European fashion, and bearing samples of gold, silver, and spices, is not known.&#8221; (347)</span>
