Just a brief trip five years down memory lane to revisit [one of the better sentences](http://chicagomaroon.com/2008/04/22/editorial-undergraduate-liaison-to-the-board-of-trustees-endorsement/) written about me to date:

> Potok’s sophomoric personal attacks against outgoing liaison Hollie Gilman may be gratuitous, but they do not detract substantively from his ideas or campaign.

I took this as a compliment, because I was only a freshman at the time! It pairs well with my recent [letter](http://chicagomaroon.com/2013/11/10/letter-models-matter/) to the same newspaper:

> When I majored in economics at the University of Chicago, the coursework was taught with an eye towards the complexity of the outside world and an understanding that “models”­­­—a word Golovashkina uses as an epithet—are the scientific way to best understand that complexity. A simple map does not imply a simple territory; I’d recommend Jorge Luis Borges’ “On Exactitude in Science” to anyone still confused about the usefulness of a life-sized map.

Finally, someone named Louis Potok was [buying real estate in Chicago](http://books.google.com/books?id=ykZOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1224&lpg=PA1224&dq=%22louis+potok%22&source=bl&ots=2KHo3Xi_Wn&sig=2obRdvQokz9ENccoQqIzy-aJuOc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=fl2AUrDwO_Tc4AP72oHwAw&ved=0CEIQ6AEwAzge#v=onepage&q=%22louis%20potok%22&f=false) in 1922.
