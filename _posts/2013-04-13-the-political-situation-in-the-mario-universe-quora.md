Everyone loves Quora and [here](http://www.quora.com/Mario-series/What-is-the-political-situation-in-the-Mario-universe) is one reason why:

> What is the political situation in the Mario universe?
> 
> It is a never-ending condition of war within and war without, fraught and constantly changing as one faction or another vies for control, riven along racial and ideological fault-lines and held together only by the intervention of **foreign** interlopers, propping up the dominant superpower and whose ultimate motivations are shrouded in secrecy.

Edit (2021): Quora has gotten much worse since 2013.
