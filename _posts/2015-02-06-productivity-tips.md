Here are my five tips to be more productive. They are backed by years of economic research:

  1. Be born in a Western country
  2. Be born after the industrial revolution
  3. Go to college
  4. Specialize in a field where you have a comparative advantage
  5. Live in a system of exchange and allocation that incentivizes production
